Intention:
* This utility can be used by the IPv6 enabled initscripts for better duplicate
address detection on setup of IPv6 addresses

* Also migrate "ip6_int" of Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au> into this utility


Known bugs:
* ipv6calc is sure not the securest C program around the world


Contents:
* "ipv6calc": the main utility
* "ipv6calcweb": CGI wrapper for ipv6calc's address information output
* "ipv6logconv": log converter (IPv4/IPv6)
* "ipv6loganon": log anonymizer (IPv4/IPv6)
* "ipv6logstats": log statistic generator (IPv4/IPv6)
* "mod_ipv6calc": Apache module


Included internal databases:
* IEEE IAB, OUI, OUI-36 databases (for decoding vendor part of MAC/EUI-48/EUI-64)
* IPv4 assignment databases from IANA, ARIN, RIPENCC, APNIC, LACNIC, AFRINIC (for selecting proper registry in ipv6calcweb.cgi and IPv4 anonymization)
* IPv6 assignment databases from IANA, ARIN, RIPENCC, APNIC, LACNIC, AFRINIC (for selecting proper registry in ipv6calcweb.cgi and IPv6 anonymization)
* ASN assignment databases from IANA, ARIN, RIPENCC, APNIC, LACNIC, AFRINIC (for IPv4/IPv6 anonymization)

Supported external databases:
* GeoIP
* GeoIP(MaxMindDB) - internally handled as GEOIP2
* IP2Location
* DB-IP.com
* DB-IP.com(MaxMindDB) - internally handled as DBIP2
