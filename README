Intention:
* This utility can be used by the IPv6 enabled initscripts for better duplicate
address detection on setup of IPv6 addresses

* Also migrate "ip6_int" of Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au> into this utility

Known bugs:
* Utility use several dangerous standard C functions like sscanf, sprintf and does normally no tests to prevent buffer overflows
