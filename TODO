Features requested from others:

-call no kernel-specific or userland-specific functions, just C.

ipv6calc C library would contain routines to represent the
following forms (and convert between them):
  -x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x                       
  -::                                    
  -x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d
  -ipv6-address/prefix-length
  -scoped_address%scope_id
  -base 85 (compact notation)
  -URL's
  -binary labels
  -comparing addresses, v4/v4, v4/v6
  -not use malloc or strxxx functions.
