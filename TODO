TODO list
=========

Short term
----------
Fix configure script message "checking for  in -lcrypto... no"
	-> help needed from outside

Convert version script for ipv6calcweb.cgi from Perl to Shell or autoconf, because some systems have no Perl available


Middle term
-----------

Documentation:
* manpage (never wrote one, therefore need help)

Features:
* showinfo/machinereadable:
    should be able to switch between multiline and single line mode (source is already prepared)
    should be able to print a prefix on tokens (source is already prepared)A

Data libraries
* print date of last update in version information

IEEE/OUI library:
* perhaps more filtering of unnecessary information

Creating a dedicated output library

Code cleanup:
* finish splint

Help:
* add more examples in inline help

ipv6calcweb.cgi:
* add alarm wrapper around call of ipv6calc



Features requested from others:

-call no kernel-specific or userland-specific functions, just C.

  -x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x                       
  -::                                    
  -x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d
  -ipv6-address/prefix-length
  -scoped_address%scope_id
  -base 85 (compact notation)
  -URL's
  -binary labels
  -comparing addresses, v4/v4, v4/v6
  -not use malloc or strxxx functions.
