TODO list

Documentation:
* manpage (never wrote one, therefore need help)

Features:
* showinfo/machinereadable:
    should be able to switch between multiline and single line mode (source is already prepared)
    should be able to print a prefix on tokens (source is already prepared)

Format features
* printprefix, printsuffix for full

IEEE/OUI library:
* perhaps more filtering of unnecessary information

Creating a dedicated output library

Code cleanup:
 * replace sprintf with snprintf
 * splint



Features requested from others:

-call no kernel-specific or userland-specific functions, just C.

ipv6calc C library would contain routines to represent  the
following forms (and convert between them):
  -x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x                       
  -::                                    
  -x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d
  -ipv6-address/prefix-length
  -scoped_address%scope_id
  -base 85 (compact notation)
  -URL's
  -binary labels
  -comparing addresses, v4/v4, v4/v6
  -not use malloc or strxxx functions.
