ipv6loganon is a HTTP server log file anonymizer

It expect a log line on stdin with an IPv4/IPv6 address as first token.

This token would be anonymized according to given/default options.

The anonymizer would keep as much information as possible for IPv6 address types.

Client-side IID would be anonymized by
 - EUI-48 based: serial number would be zero'ed, keeping OID
 - EUI-64 based: serial number would be zero'ed, keeping OID
 - ISATAP: client IPv4 address would be anonymized by given IPv4 mask
 - TEREDO: client IPv4 address would be anonymized by given IPv4 mask
           client port would be zero'ed
 - 6to4(Microsoft): client IPv4 address would be anonymized by given IPv4 mask
 - local: whole IID would be zero'ed

Client-side SLA would be anonymized by 
 - SLA would be zero'ed

Prefix would be anonymized by
 - 6to4: client IPv4 address would be anonymized by given IPv4 mask

Compat/Mapped IPv4 addresses would be anonymized by
 - IPv4 address would be anonymized by given IPv4 mask



Afterwards, the modified address and the trailing line would be printed to stdout.


Example:

Original lines (stdin):

Since version 0.90.0 also inline usage in Apache webserver is supported like:

httpd.conf:
	CustomLog "|/usr/local/bin/ipv6loganon -a -f /var/log/httpd/access_log" combined

 in conjunction with cronolog:
	CustomLog "|/usr/bin/ipv6loganon -f |/usr/sbin/cronolog /var/log/httpd/access.log-%Y%m%d" combined
