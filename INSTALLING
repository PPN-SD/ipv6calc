ipv6calc

                               INSTALLING

Please read the file `README' before you start with the installation of the
ipv6calc.


USING RPM
---------
This tar-ball provides a spec file for building an source and binary RPM using
	rpmbuild -ta ipv6calc-$version.tar.gz

	Available build options:
	 --with ip2location
	 --with geoip

After successful build you got two packages:
	one source RPM ipv6calc-$version-$release.src.rpm
	and one binary RPM ipv6calc-$version-$release.$arch.rpm

For installing use
	rpm -ihv ipv6calc-$version-$release.$arch.rpm
For updating use
	rpm -Fhv ipv6calc-$version-$release.$arch.rpm
For deinstalling use
	rpm -e ipv6calc


HACKERS WAY
-----------
cd /usr/src ; tar xvzf ipv6calc*.tar.gz

./configure --exec_prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man && make && make test && make -n install exec_prefix=/usr
make install exec_prefix=/usr


If you want to suppress configure's exec_prefix, specify bindir directly, e.g.

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --bindir /usr/local/bin --mandir /usr/local/share/man



For Solaris 8 you need following packages installed:
autoconf
automake
gcc
make
binutils
cvs (optional)
perl
m4


CONFIGURE
---------
There is a configure script available.

Following options are used:
 --bindir=/usr/bin  (@bindir@)
 --mandir=/usr/share/man (@mandir@)
 --enable-ip2location (see below for more information)
 --enable-geoip (see below for more information)

Execute:
 ./configure --bindir=/usr/bin --mandir=/usr/share/man


UPDATE OF DATABASES
-------------------
ipv6calc contains several databases, currently
* OUI type (IEEE)
* IAB type (IEEE)
* IPv4 address space assignment
* IPv6 address space assignment
to update this database before compilation you need:
- install perl, wget, aggregate
- run "make update"

See also:
 ./databases/registries/README
 ./databases/ipv4-assignment/README
 ./databases/ipv6-assignment/README
 ./databases/ieee-iab/README
 ./databases/ieee-oui/README


IP2LOCATION LIBRARY
-------------------
You can use the IP2Location library with ipv6calc. The library is available
at <http://www.ip2location.com/c.aspx>, and the currently supported version
is at least 2.1.3 (versions below are NOT supported). The support is
enabled with the --enable-ip2location configure option.

If you have installed the IP2Location library in a non-standard place, you
may find the --with-ip2location-headers=DIR and --with-ip2location-lib=DIR
configure options useful. If you have problems finding the library at
runtime, try linking it statically the --with-ip2location-static configure
option.

If you have problems building the IP2Location library, see the
README.BUILDING-IP2LOCATION file in the ipv6calc distribution.


GEOIP LIBRARY
-------------
You can also use the GeoIP library with ipv6calc. The library is available
at <http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location>, and the currently supported
version is 1.4.1 (although others may work too). The support is enabled
with the --enable-geoip configure option.

If you have installed the GeoIP library in a non-standard place, you may
find the --with-geoip-headers=DIR and --with-geoip-lib=DIR configure
options useful. If you have problems finding the library at runtime,
try linking it statically the --with-geoip-static configure option.

You can set the path to a default GeoIP database file by using the
--with-geoip-default-file configure option. This file is used
when ipv6calc is invoked with the '-G' (or '--db-geoip-default')
option.


PREPARATIONS
------------
"make update" updates the databases for static built-in
"make distclean" cleans the source
"make updateclean" also cleans the database header files


COMPILE
-------  
To compile simply use "make".

There should be no warnings or errors occur.


TESTING
-------
It's very recommended to test the created binaries using "make test" or at least
"make test-minimal" (this skips external database related tests).

If using a build system, which has not GeoIP or IP2Location databases installed,
but support was was enabled, use at least "make test-minimal"


INSTALLATION
------------
If you want to install the binary use "make install".
